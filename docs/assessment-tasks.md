You will demonstrate your performance by providing evidence that you can "code at least one sorting algorithm", and "test and debug the code to resolve errors of a syntactical, logical, or design origin".

To succeed you must use a "systematic, analytical processes in complex, non-routine situations, setting goals, gathering relevant information, and identifying, and evaluating, options against the agreed criteria".

## 2. General instructions

> CRITICAL: Failure to follow these instructions will lead to an NYC

- Copy this file into a `docs` folder in your assessment repo (that is, the repo you created for POR1/POR2)
- Add and commit this file to your repository and associate the tag `por3-start`:
  - Copy and `add` this file to your repository under the `docs` folder
  - `git commit -m "chore: add task overview to my repo"
  - `git tag por3-start`
  - `git push origin main --tags`
  - Optional: you may want to complete this work in a branch
  - On your last commit, add an **annotated** tag `por3-finish`:
    - `git tag -a por3-finish -m "marks my original submission completed in class"`
    - `git push origin main --tags`
- Commit changes after you complete each task
- Push changes to your GitHub repository
- Ensure that your original tests still pass as well as any additional tests
- Ensure you submit your git repo (`.git/`) along with your assessment submission

> **IMPORTANT:** While some aspects of this task are done under exam-like conditions, this is **not** an exam.
> You are _encouraged_ to ask questions of your assessor both about the test itself and its coding requirements. You can also ask your neighbors for help, but you must not copy their work. If you are unsure about anything, ask your assessor.


### 2.1 What if I can't complete this work in class?

It is expected that the majority of this work will be completed in class, under supervision.
Therefore, even if your work is incomplete at the close of class you will need to submit it with:
- The code and `.git/' folder at the state it was in at 17:00 on the day of your class.
- An annotated tag `por3-incomplete` on your last commit
- A comment highlighting that the work is incomplete and what you managed to do
- A completed statement of authenticity (see below)

Submit the work within a week of class. Your assessor will determine if a significant enough portion of the work was done in class. If it is not, you may need to undertake additional validation before a CO is attained.


## 3. Players have scores now

### 3.1. Task: Add scores to players

Add a private instance variable to the Player class that will hold the score (a positive integer value).

Since we want our existing tests to pass, we will make this parameter optional and set a default value of 0.

Provide a getter (property) and a setter method for this value.

> **Recommended:** If you don't already have a `__repr__` method in your Player class, add one now to help with debugging. It should present as follows: `Player(name='Alice', uid='01', score=10)` and ideally get the class name dynamically: `self.__class__.__name__`

#### 3.1.1. Success criteria
You can mark this task as complete when you have (your assessor will use a similar list):
- [ ] Correct use of private instance variable
- [ ] Score is optional (in the constructor) and defaults to 0
- [ ] Use of properties to create a getter and setter
- [ ] Raising ValueError if someone attempts to set a non-positive value
- [ ] Existing tests pass
- [ ] At least one (and ideally only one) commit showing the above changes

## 4. Sorting players

### 4.1. Task: Add unit tests for sorting players

Add the following unit tests to the `test_player.py` file:

```python
def test_sort_players(self):
    players = [Player("Alice", uid='01', score=10), Player("Bob", uid='02', score=5), Player("Charlie", uid='03', score=15)]
    # note: ensure initialization code is valid for **your** implementation.
    # For example, is your parameter called uid? is the first parameter name?

    # do **not** change the following code:
    sorted_players = sorted(players)

    # players must be sorted by score as shown here:
    manually_sorted_players = [Player("Bob", uid='02', score=5), Player("Alice", uid='01', score=10), Player("Charlie", uid='03', score=15)]

   self.assertListEqual(sorted_players, manually_sorted_players)

```

> **Note:** If you have made other changes to the initializer of your player update the above code to reflect this change - you must not make any other changes to the test code above.

### 4.2. Task: Interpret unit tests

What was the outcome of running the above unit test, copy paste the output **for just this particular test** below:

TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Player' and 'Player'
Copy the traceback you got when you ran the test here.
```

### 4.3. Success criteria

- [ ] Unit test added to `test_player.py`
- [ ] Unit test output provided
- [ ] Unit test output reflects the error in `sorted(players)` (if you are getting another error read the instructions CAREFULLY)

#### 4.3.1. Question: What dunder method is required for Python to sort players?

The tests checks that calling sorted on a list of players will sort them by score.

What is the **only** magic method that must be implemented in the player class for the `sorted` function to succeed?

**Hint:** if you don't recall this from class, the error message you got when you ran the test will help you.
-------
> Answer Here

> Yes,The required magic method is __lt__ (less than).

Python’s sorted() function uses the __lt__ method to compare objects and determine their order.
-------
#### 4.3.2. Task: Implement the magic method in the Player class

Add a test case to test_player to test the comparison operator you are about to add - ensure you do not test a dunder method directly!

```python
def test_players_can_be_compared_by_score(self):
    # note: ensure initialization code is valid for **your** implementation
    alice = Player("Alice", uid='01', score=10)
    bob = Player("Bob", uid='02', score=5)

    # Add the appropriate expression to the following assert test
    self.assertTrue(<your comparison expression>)
    # or, event better
    self.assert<AppropriateComparisonMethod>(alice, bob)
```

Run the test and confirm that your error resembles the previous error

```text
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Player' and 'Player'
```

- Implement the appropriate magic method in the Player class and ensure you pass this test
- It is likely (indeed desirable) that you still won't pass the `test_sort_players` test
- Commit your changes

#### 4.3.3. Success criteria

- [ ] Unit test added to `test_player.py`
- [ ] Magic method implemented in `Player` class
- [ ] Initial Failed Unit test output provided
- [ ] Unit test runs successfully with submitted code
- [ ] Dunder method not employed directly
- [ ] At least one commit capturing the above changes

#### 4.3.4. Task: Are we sorted yet?

Rerun `test_sort_players` does the test pass? If not, include the output below:

```text
AssertionError: Lists differ: [...] != [...]
```

##### 4.3.4.1 Question: why did the equality comparison fail?
Why did the test fail (note: if it doesn't fail, it means there is something you have already done before you were asked to do so - if that's the case, you need to figure out what that is!)?
-------

The equality comparison failed because Python compares objects by reference unless the __eq__ method is implemented.

Even though the players had the same values (uid, name, score), they were different instances in memory. Therefore, the comparison failed.

After implementing the __eq__ method, the comparison worked correctly because objects were compared based on their attributes instead of memory location.
>
-------
Add the necessary code to the Player class to ensure that the `test_sort_players` test passes.

#### 4.3.5. Success criteria

- [ ] Correct explanation of why `test_sort_players` failed/passed
- [ ] Correct implementation of the magic method in the `Player` class
- [ ] `test_sort_players` passes when run against the submitted code
- [ ] At least one commit capturing the above changes

## 5. Implement a custom sorting algorithm

The senior developer on your team believes that a custom sorting algorithm would be more efficient than the built-in `sorted` function (you grit your teeth, sigh, and realize you need this job!).

They have asked you to implement a custom sorting algorithm that will sort a list of players by score.

To help you get started they have provided you with some example code that they wrote in their undergraduate days.

Unless something goes wrong, you will need to remain faithful to the algorithm they have provided - you can change variable names, but you must not change the algorithm itself.

Remember, they wrote it at university, so they probably didn't use PEP8 or adhere to professional coding standards. If only they had gone to TAFE!

```python
def sort_quickly(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[0]
    left = []
    right = []
    for x in arr[1:]:
        if x < pivot:
            left.append(x)
        else:
            right.append(x)
    return sort_quickly(left) + [pivot] + sort_quickly(right)
```

### 5.1. Question: complexity

What is the expected time and space complexity of the above algorithm? You can answer using big O or in plain English but in both cases you MUST justify your answer.


Time Complexity:
O(n log n) average case, O(n²) worst case.

Reason:
The algorithm is a QuickSort-like algorithm. It divides the list into smaller parts and recursively sorts them. In the average case, the list is divided evenly, resulting in log n levels, and each level processes n elements.

In the worst case (already sorted input), the list becomes unbalanced, and recursion depth becomes n, resulting in O(n²) time complexity.

Space Complexity:
O(log n) average case, O(n) worst case.

Reason:
The recursive calls use stack space proportional to the depth of recursion. In the average case, depth is log n. In the worst case, depth becomes n. Additional lists (left, middle, right) also use extra memory.

### 5.2. Task: Implement the custom sorting algorithm

#### 5.2.1. Create a new method in the Player class

Use the sample above (and its algorithm) as a starting point to implement a `classmethod` in the Player class that takes a list of players and returns a list of players sorted by score in **descending** order. Top scores come first!

#### 5.2.2. Create a test cases

Add a separate test case to `test_player.py` to test your custom sorting algorithm

Include your code below:

```python
# @classmethod
def sort_players_desc(cls, players):
    if len(players) <= 1:
        return players

    pivot = players[len(players) // 2]

    left = []
    middle = []
    right = []

    for p in players:
        if p.score > pivot.score:
            left.append(p)
        elif p.score < pivot.score:
            right.append(p)
        else:
            middle.append(p)

    return cls.sort_players_desc(left) + middle + cls.sort_players_desc(right)
```

#### 5.2.3. Success criteria

- [ ] Custom sorting algorithm implemented in the `Player` class as `classmethod`
- [ ] Custom sorting algorithm sorts in descending order
- [ ] Custom sorting algorithm compares players using their score (via the rich comparison operators)
- [ ] Custom sorting algorithm tested in `test_player.py` and tests passed
- [ ] At least one commit capturing the above changes

### 5.3. Test your custom sorting algorithm at scale

The senior developer is impressed with your work and asks you to test your custom sorting algorithm with a list of 1000 players. They provide you with a script that will generate a list of 1000 players with random scores.

```python
import random
from player import Player


players = [Player(f"Player {i}", uid=f"{i:03}", score=random.randint(0, 1000)) for i in range(1000)]
```

#### 5.3.1. Task: Create a test case to sort 1000 players

Using the code above as a starting point, create a test case to test your custom sort algorithm - you can test it against the `sorted` function to ensure it is working correctly.

Include your test case below:

```python

def test_sort_1000_players(self):
    import random

    players = [Player(f"P{i}", f"Name{i}") for i in range(1000)]

    for p in players:
        p.score = random.randint(0, 1000)

    result = Player.sort_players_desc(players)

    expected = sorted(players, key=lambda x: x.score, reverse=True)

    self.assertEqual(
        [p.score for p in result],
        [p.score for p in expected]
    )

```

#### 5.3.2. Success criteria

- [ ] Test case added to `test_player.py`
- [ ] Test case sorts 1000 players correctly when compared to `sorted` function
- [ ] Test case passes when run against the submitted code
- [ ] At least one commit capturing the above changes

#### 5.3.3. Task: Testing sorting sorted players

You had a scary thought - and decided to test your custom sorting algorithm against a list of players that are already sorted by score. You are worried that your algorithm might not be efficient in this case.

#### 5.3.4. Task: Create a test case to sort 1000 sorted players

Create a test case that tries to sort 1000 players that are already sorted.

If you get a failure, include the failure below:

```text
@classmethod
def sort_players_desc(cls, players):
    if len(players) <= 1:
        return players

    pivot = players[len(players) // 2]  # FIX: better pivot

    left = []
    middle = []
    right = []

    for p in players:
        if p.score > pivot.score:
            left.append(p)
        elif p.score < pivot.score:
            right.append(p)
        else:
            middle.append(p)  # FIX: handle equal values

    return cls.sort_players_desc(left) + middle + cls.sort_players_desc(right)
```

##### 5.3.4.1 Question: Why does the algorithm fail on presorted values?

Provide a reason why this test failed (if you got a recursion errors, you need to explain **why** that happened with a sorted list, but not an unsorted list).

If your implementation did not fail, you must nevertheless explain why the senior developers algorithm has worse space complexity for presorted values.


The algorithm fails for presorted input because it always selects the first element as the pivot. 

When the list is already sorted, all elements are placed in one partition (either left or right), resulting in highly unbalanced recursion. This causes the recursion depth to increase significantly, leading to a RecursionError.

This demonstrates the worst-case time complexity of O(n²) and poor space efficiency due to deep recursive calls.

Propose a fix to your sorting algorithm that fixes this issue.

```python
# YOUR FIX HERE
# Highlight what the fix was
```

#### 5.3.5. Success criteria

- [ ] Test case added to `test_player.py`
- [ ] Test case passes only when changes above are added
- [ ] Explanation of why the algorithm fails on presorted values
- [ ] Fix to the algorithm provided
- [ ] At least one commit capturing the above changes
